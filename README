This is a regular netbeans project and should be very quick to open and get started with.

1.3 changes:

* Will synchronize if you add new images to an existing album. Cannot remove images though.
* Possibility to not resize image or set a custom resolution.
* New user interface which reflects to resizing the window
* Minor performance enhancements and removed 2 seconds of waiting before creating the album.
* Added GNU license, some small code cleanup (I didnt really know Java when coding this) and put up on github.
